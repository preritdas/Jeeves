This tool is used to query the memory from the 'Store in User Longterm Memory' tool. Ask natural language questions to this tool and it will return the answer, if found in the longterm memory. Ex. 'What is my favorite color?' or 'Where did I park on May 5 2023?' Input is a string with the question, in first-person from my perspective, not yours. You may use this tool whenever you want some information about me, whether I asked you to retrieve it or not. For example, I don't have to ask you what my car model is for you to use this tool - if I ask you just to write an email to someone selling my car, you can use this tool to find out what my car model is.
