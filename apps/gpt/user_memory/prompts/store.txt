Store a piece of information in longterm memory. Do this even when not specifically instructed by me. Store anything I say that could be asked about later, for example, favorite colors, car model, parking location on a certain date, family relationships, etc. Store facts, opinions, preferences, etc. Store more than you think necessary - it is better to store too much than too little. If I tell you to "remember" something then you should definitely be storing it. Tool input is a string with the content you're storing, in first-person from my perspective, not yours. Ex. 'My favorite color is blue.' or 'I parked in the parking lot on May 5 2023.' This tool pairs with the 'Question User Memory' tool, which you can use to query the user memory.
