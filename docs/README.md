# Meet Jeeves.

Jeeves is a first-of-its-kind AI personal assistant designed to make your life easier and more efficient. You can text him, call him, or even send him Telegram voice messages when you're on the go.

Jeeves is entirely unique to you, offering advanced functions such as:

* Making outbound calls for reservations, appointments, speaking with your friends... Jeeves will hold a conversation with humans (and robots) on the other side of the line to facilitate goals
* Seamlessly integrating with tools like Microsoft Teams, Discord, Todoist, and Notion to be an effective assistant in comprehensive areas of your life
* Supporting one-click Zapier integration to access most-any of your tools, with [thousands available](https://zapier.com/apps).

Built upon state-of-the-art LLMs both fine-tuned and re-engineered, coupled with careful implementation of complex operations, Jeeves is incredibly accurate, performant, efficient, and boasts an impressive success rate (your human personal assistant would never walk up to you and say "Error, could not parse output").

## Example Use Case

Jeeves is yours - use him as you see fit. The following are some basic usage examples. Jeeves is constantly being outfitted with new capabilities, quite literally every day, not to mention that you can instantly provide him access to new tools through Zapier, as mentioned above.

When speaking with me personally, Jeeves can...

* Search the internet
* Read websites and articles
* Watch YouTube videos
* Synthesize information (news, etc.)
* Perform quantitative calculations
* Make outbound calls to friends/family/businesses/etc.
* Read my email
* Reply to emails
* Write new emails
* Send text messages to others as himself
* Manage my calendar (read events, create events and invites, create video conference links)
* Use my contacts to find peoples' emails/phone numbers for various other operations
* Send messages (as himself, on my behalf) to my team on Discord
* Send messages (as himself, on my behalf) through Microsoft Teams
* Utilize his and my long-term memory for ever-increasing comprehensiveness

Of course, he can do any and all of these things together according to the task/question at hand. For example, if I told him to "text Bob Brown today's business news that pertains to Yellen Yellow's last email, then make a reservation at Good Food Restaurant when I'm free tomorrow" Jeeves will...

1. Search my email for Yellen Yellow's message and read it
2. Use the internet to find today's business news
3. Search my contacts for Bob Brown's phone number
4. Send a text message to Bob Brown (as himself, Jeeves) sharing the business news that pertains to Yellen's email, letting him know it originates from me
5. Check my calendar to see when I have free time tomorrow evening (say, 7 p.m. until 10 p.m.)
6. Search the internet for Good Food Restaurant's phone number (location-specific)
7. Call Good Food Restaurant and have a full conversation with the hostess asking to make a reservation for 2 people tomorrow at 7 p.m. Perhaps the hostess says she can only accommodate us at 7:30 p.m., which Jeeves will accept because he knows I'm free until 10 p.m.
8. Search my contacts for Bob Brown's email address
9. Create an event in my calendar for dinner tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at GFR and invite Bob Brown
10. Finally, respond to me letting me know that dinner has been scheduled for tomorrow and Bob Brown has been both invited and informed of today's business news pertaining to Yellen's email.

## The Magic of Jeeves

Jeeves' success is attributed to:

1. Fine-tuned models and re-engineering (both model- and prompt-level) from months of obsessive work on other AI platforms
2. Careful integration of various tools, such as low-level call-sequence API routers and real-time information handling
3. Rigorous testing and model re-evaluation to ensure a seamless, efficient, and quick user experience that comes as close to a competent human assistant as possible, if not better

Safety is a priority; Jeeves creates drafts of emails for you to review before sending and always discloses that he is an AI representing you when communicating with others in any form.

## The Future of Jeeves

As a rapidly evolving project, Jeeves is in active development, with new improvements, features, and tools added daily.

As a general thought, with the releases of powerful models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, particularly with the time for developers to craft innovative ways of leveraging them, AI-powered tools like Jeeves will become increasingly prevalent. He may be the first of his kind, but will certainly not be the last.

This documentation explores Jeeves' inner workings, tooling, and future expectations as a powerful implementation of a technology we humans are yet to understand.

### Try Jeeves

Jeeves is currently in closed testing (in other words, I'm hogging him for myself and family/friends). If you're interested in giving him employment—making him your gentleman, let's say—please reach out to me.
