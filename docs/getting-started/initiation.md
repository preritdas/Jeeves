# â›¸ Initiation

## Tool Categories

As mentioned on the [first page](../#example-use-case), Jeeves can do a _lot_. His power is split between...

1. Default built-in tools. These will let him search the web, read websites/articles, watch YouTube videos, and make outbound calls. So, with no additional setup, you can ask Jeeves to call restaurants and make reservations, or whatever your heart desires.
2. Automatically authenticated tools. This is sending text messages... all that's needed to build this authenticated tool is your phone number, i.e. you as a user. This happens automatically. Sending texts message is an authenticated process because every text message Jeeves sends is automatically forwarded to you, so you can keep an eye on who he's talking to.
3. Zapier authenticated tools. This is where you can connect [thousands of services](https://zapier.com/apps) to Jeeves automatically. Just by searching and toggling tools in your Zapier account, with no extra steps, Jeeves will be able to access those tools, from managing your email and calendar to sending Discord messages and so on. Setting this up at the get-go requires connecting your Zapier account.
4. Telegram. If you want to communicate with Jeeves through Telegram for the voice messages capability, you'll have to configure your Telegram user ID. Don't worry - when you message Jeeves on Telegram the first time, he will tell you he doesn't recognize you and give you your ID. Telegram has a nicer interface than SMS, allows you to send voice messages, and is easier on my wallet. ;)

## Initial Setup

Because Jeeves is currently in private demo mode, I'll have to set Jeeves up for you initially (BTW, I was thoroughly shocked by the number of access requests I received via the form on the landing page, and am working through them).&#x20;

This is a super simple process. All you'll need to provide is your name, phone number, gender (so Jeeves can address you correctly), and your time zone. Then, you're good to go with his default functionality.&#x20;

## Manual Intervention

A quick note on the need for me to manually facilitate some of these steps. Until Jeeves has a frontend, I'll have to do certain setup steps for you manually, as you'll see in the following pages. The two main places are providing you with your unique Zapier setup link and adding your Telegram ID. Once these are done, however, I am no longer needed. As mentioned on the [Zapier](zapier.md) page, you can add, remove, or edit any added tools using my provider page at any point.
