## Connecting to Zapier

The process of connecting your Zapier account is quite simple. I will provide you with a link unique to you, which will automatically redirect you to a page looking like this (if you don't have a Zapier account).&#x20;

Sign up (or log in). Once you have, you'll automatically be taken to a page that looks like this.

At this point, you'll want to consider if you trust me or not. When you click allow, Zapier will ping Jeeves with a code, with which he will enter an authentication handshake with Zapier and store a token he can use to interact with your Zapier tools.&#x20;

A window will open, looking like this, but without the actions I've already configured.&#x20;

Click on "Add Action" at the bottom, and search for anything your heart desires. You'll be able to configure each action and the fields within. For example, my "Discord: Send Message" action is configured to hard code the channel it sends messages in. Jeeves will not be able to "guess" or "decide" what channel to use. You can hard code and override any field in any action.

As soon as you enable actions in this window, Jeeves has access to them. Nothing else required.

## Updating Connected Tools

After the initial setup, to change the tools Jeeves has access to (add more, modify configurations, remove tools), visit [nla.zapier.com/preritdas/actions](https://nla.zapier.com/preritdas/actions).&#x20;

Changes propagate instantly. Use this as your portal to manage the Zapier tools Jeeves has access to on your behalf. Changes in this portal will automatically translate to Jeeves' arsenal, with no extra steps required.
