# Bill Split


Easily start a bill splitting session, with suggested tips, and split the cost. This app is very new, being merged into the `master` production branch on 10/31/22. Docs to come. The app's help and options are built, however, so sending `options: help = yes` is the best way to get info on the app from production right now.


| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| action | Either `start` or `close`. If not specified, you are participating. |
| total | Only if you are creating a new session with `options: action = start`. |
